                <p>I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Optum. I graduated Brandeis University in 2016, where I earned my BS in Computer Science
                and minors in Business and Economics. I've worked on many different projects spanning across many different programming langauges and frameworks.
                I'm almost always looking for more and exciting work on the side, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you're looking for an engineer to
                help with a project. Outside of programming, I like to play sports, watch TV and documentaries, and hang out with friends and family.
